# covid19

In this project I used https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/states api to ajax get method to retrieve the data from each of the states as well as other american territories etc. 
"Today" data resets at night and sets cases today, number of deaths today to 0. 

The data pulled for each state or territory consists of : 
        Total Cases, number of cases today, total deaths, number of deaths today, and active cases.

Added to this project news articles relating to covid19. To accomplish this I utilized the nytimes api and pulled 10 covid19 articles and displayed it on the project for users.
