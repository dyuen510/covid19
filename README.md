# covid19

In this project I used https://corona.lmao.ninja/states api to ajax get method to retrieve the data from each of the states as well as other american territories etc. 

The data pulled for each state or territory consists of : 
        Total Cases, number of cases today, total deaths, number of deaths today, and active cases.
